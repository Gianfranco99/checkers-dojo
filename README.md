# Checkers

![Checkers Game](/the-marquis/packages/nextjs/public/landingpage/BannerChecker2.png)

Checkers is a classic board game implemented in a web environment using the Dojo Engine. This project leverages Starknetâ€™s Layer 2 to create a fully decentralized, on-chain checkers game. All game logic, including player moves, validations, and win conditions, is implemented with smart contracts on Starknet, ensuring transparency and fairness.
